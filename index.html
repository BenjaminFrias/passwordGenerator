				<h2>What makes a password strong?</h2>

				<ul>
					<li>
						<h3>Strong passwords are unique and random.</h3>
						<p>
							Humans arenâ€™t very good at coming up with passwords
							that are either of those things, let alone both. So
							we created the 1Password Strong Password Generator
							to create secure, memorable passwords for you. 81%
							of data breaches are caused by reused or weak
							passwords, so random, unique passwords are your best
							defense against online threats.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h3>Why should my password be unique?</h3>
						<p>
							If you use the same password for both your email
							account and your bank account login, an attacker
							only needs to steal one password to get access to
							both accounts, doubling your exposure. If you've
							used that same password for 14 different accounts,
							you're making the attacker's job very, very easy.
							You can protect yourself by using a generator to
							create unique passwords that are easy to remember.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h3>Why should my password be random?</h3>
						<p>
							Random passwords are hard to guess and harder for
							computer programs to crack. If there's a discernible
							pattern, the odds of an attacker using a brute force
							attack and gaining access to your account goes up
							exponentially. Random passwords might contain a
							jumble of unrelated characters, but combining
							unrelated words also works. That's how the 1Password
							Strong Password Generator creates passwords that are
							easy to remember but still cryptographically strong.
